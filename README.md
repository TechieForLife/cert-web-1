# Web Fundamentals 1: HTML
In this project, you will be learning the basics about what makes up a web page: Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML). This project should only use HTML and no CSS. If you don't know what CSS is at this point, its ok that will come later. 

## Getting started
Make sure you start with a basic HTML scaffold that every html page needs like a `<!DOCTYPE html>`, a `head` and a `body` tag. There is a starter scaffold in this code repository with the filename: `starter.html`. Make sure to fill your site with data of some sort. I would recommend using a wikipedia page about something interesting, like the majestic octopus. 

## Assignment
Build a simple infomational site on any topic you'd like using only HTML elements. Below is a list of required HTML element that MUST be used on your site if you want credit for this project:

	- h1 (or any other h tag 1-6)
	- p
	- b
	- u
	- br
	- hr
	- strong
	- i
	- div
	- a (with a link to an external site)
	- img (with the src attribute linking to an external image)
	- img (where the image is a link to an external page)
	- ul (with at least 3 nested <li> elements)
	- ol (with at least 3 nested <li> elements)
	- input (type="text")
	- checkbox
	- select (with 3 or more options)
	- table (with 3 columns and 3 rows)
